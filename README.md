# 🚀Smart-IoT-Parcel-Delivery-Chamber
Receiving online deliveries when you're away from home can be risky or inconvenient. My solution? A smart delivery chamber that allows authorized delivery and secure retrieval using automation, sensors, and IoT.


## 🔍 Problem Statement
Ever missed an important parcel because you weren’t home?
Relying on neighbors or risking doorstep theft isn't a reliable solution.

## 💡 The Solution
I designed and built a Smart Parcel Chamber that securely handles deliveries even when the recipient isn’t home. It’s powered by IoT, automation, and a bit of creativity!


## ⚙️ Working Process
Our Smart Parcel Delivery Chamber automates secure parcel drop-off and pickup using sensors, motors, and a microcontroller. Here's how it works, step-by-step:
### ✅ 1. Delivery Access
    The delivery agent enters a common passcode on a 4x4 keypad.
    If correct:
      - The system unlocks the chamber using a servo motor (can be replaced with a solenoid lock for improved security).
      - A stepper motor opens the door automatically.
